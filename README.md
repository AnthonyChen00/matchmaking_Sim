>The main purpose behind this project is to analyze and weigh the consequences of using geolocation as a tool to create more optimized groupings in matchmaking queues. This will be tested with a live queue of users, and our server will create groupings of five within the users. One user will be the host of that group, meaning that all of the other users in the group are connecting to that one host. Their connection status will be calculated through pinging. We will be analyzing the efficiency of our matchmaking algorithm using mainly 2 criteria:
>Time: The time it takes for the algorithm to successfully create all the groupings within a set amount of users.
Lower Overall Ping: The average amount of ping among the users within the group in respect to the host of the group.
